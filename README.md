# Updater

Prototype gtk4 application to update the OS, flatpak, brew, etc, show a progress bar based on the parsed terminal output (from `uupd --json`), and possibly (stretch goal) display the changelog(s).

- re changelogs: @AdamIsrael it'd be just snagging/caching the release notes from github releases.
